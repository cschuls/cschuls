- 👋 Hi, I’m @cschuls (You may call me Craig)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Linux and improving applications that augment its functionality such as Wine.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the C programming language.
- 💞️ 
- 📫 At my current skill level, I wish to just monitor any projects I have.  Possibly later, I will add an email address.
